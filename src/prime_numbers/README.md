1. You've to check whether a given number is prime or not.
2. Take a number "t" as input representing count of input numbers to be tested.
3. Take a number "n" as input "t" number of times.
4. For each input value of n, print "prime" if the number is prime and "not prime" otherwise.

## Constraints

```
1 <= t <= 10000
2 <= n < 10^9
```  

## Format

**Input**

```
low 
high
``` 

**Output**

```
n1 
n2
.. all primes between low and high (both included)  
```

## Example

```  

**Sample Output**
```  
7  
11
